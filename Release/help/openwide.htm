<h2>About</h2>
<p>OpenWide was written to avoid a few [more] minor annoyances with Windows.<br>
This  program  allows  you to specify the position and size of Windows' Open and<br>
Save  dialog  boxes,  and  also to specify where the initial focus should be and<br>
which view will be the default.<br>
<br>
Good luck with it and enjoy.<br>
<br>
This  is  a  test release.  Limited testing has shown it to work on a release of<br>
Win2000 Professional and a release of WinXP Home.<br>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set position and size of Open & Save dialogs<br>
<li>Set initial keyboard focus<br>
<li>Set initial view style<br>
<li>Drag & drop folders onto the title bar of an Open/Save dialog box,<br>
  and the view will change to that folder!<br>
</ul>
