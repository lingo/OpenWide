OpenWide 1.3b by Luke Hudson

About
~~~~~
OpenWide was written to avoid a few [more] minor annoyances with Windows.
This  program  allows  you to specify the position and size of Windows' Open and
Save  dialog  boxes,  and  also to specify where the initial focus should be and
which view will be the default.

Good luck with it and enjoy.

This  is  a  test release.  Limited testing has shown it to work on a release of
Win2000 Professional and a release of WinXP Home.

~~~~~~~~~
- Set position and size of Open & Save dialogs
- Set initial keyboard focus

- Drag & drop folders onto the title bar of an Open/Save dialog box,
  and the view will change to that folder!
