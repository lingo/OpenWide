About
~~~~~
OpenWide was written to avoid a few [more] minor annoyances with Windows.
This  program  allows  you to specify the position and size of Windows' Open and
Save  dialog  boxes,  and  also to specify where the initial focus should be and
which view will be the default.

Good luck with it and enjoy.
